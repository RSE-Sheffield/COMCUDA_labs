# COM4521/COM6521 Parallel Computing with GPUs 

Welcome to the git repo for COM4521 and COM6521. This repo will contain all the source and solution material for the lab classes for the University of Sheffield COM4521/COM6521 taught module.

## Downloading the Source & Solutions

You can download the worksheet, source and solution code for each lab by visiting the [course website](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/training/com4521/) and following the links which provide zip files. Alternatively you may checkout the specific branches manually. The command for doing this is

	git clone -b <branch_name> https://github.com/RSE-Sheffield/COMCUDA_labs.git

There are no files (other than this readme in the master branch).

Each week's lab has two branches containing the starting and solution code e.g. `Lab01_src` and `Lab01_sln` respectively. Lab 9 only has a solution branch, this is explained in it's corresponding lab sheet.
